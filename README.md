# CSS and Bootstrap Course Projects

In the CSS and Bootstrap course, I completed a variety of projects. Below is a list of the projects along with a description of the skills and techniques I learned while working on them.

## Visual Studio Code Challenge
This was a foundational project where I wrote a basic HTML page. The challenge introduced me to:

- Setting up a simple HTML structure.
- Understanding the fundamentals of web development tools like Visual Studio Code.

## Space Resort Project
The "Space Resort Project" was the first major project of the course. It focused on building a visually appealing webpage using CSS. Key skills learned include:

- Applying **effects on images**, such as hover states and opacity adjustments.
- Creating a **CSS menu** for navigation, including styling and layout.
- Using the `<col>` (column) tag to create structured photo containers.
- Setting a **background image** and styling it with CSS properties like `background-size`, `background-position`, and `background-repeat`.

## Online Portfolio Website
This was my first project, which has been made as a live webpage. Mainly used as a basic online portfolio, which will be updated, and changed durastically in due time.
**This portfolio is still in development, and and more HTML pages will eventually be added, as well as many other changes.**

- Applying **effects** on images, including hover states, and animations.
- Created a **CSS** enhanced navigation bar for quick selection of website sections.
- Used **FlexBoxes** to create an alternating, and in-depth look.
- Set a **Background video** using the <video> element.
      **Extra additions done in spare time**
  - Set up a **contact.php** file to allow the contact form to work.
  - utilized some very basic **JavaScript** files to add multiple useful features such as:
    1. A popup which appears immediately when the page loads.
    2. Animations on the three photos, as well as on the Submit button.
    3. A dynamic typewriter effect for the quote at the beginning of the page
    4. A form submission handler that assists with the PHP file.
