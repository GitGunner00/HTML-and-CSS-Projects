# CSS and Bootstrap Course Projects

In the CSS and Bootstrap course, I completed a variety of projects. Below is a list of the projects along with a description of the skills and techniques I learned while working on them.

## Visual Studio Code Challenge
This was a foundational project where I wrote a basic HTML page. The challenge introduced me to:

- Setting up a simple HTML structure.
- Understanding the fundamentals of web development tools like Visual Studio Code.

## Space Resort Project
The "Space Resort Project" was the first major project of the course. It focused on building a visually appealing webpage using CSS. Key skills learned include:

- Applying **effects on images**, such as hover states and opacity adjustments.
- Creating a **CSS menu** for navigation, including styling and layout.
- Using the `<col>` (column) tag to create structured photo containers.
- Setting a **background image** and styling it with CSS properties like `background-size`, `background-position`, and `background-repeat`.
